# Feynman's-Path-Integral-Formalism
Analyzing Feynman’s path integral formulation as an alternative framework for quantum mechanics, deriving the Free-Particle Propagator and Wave Equation from Feynman’s Path Integral Formalism and  Examined the connection between classical action and quantum amplitudes in the free-particle limit.
